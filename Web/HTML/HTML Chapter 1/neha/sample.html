<h1>Hello World</h1>
 <!-- a heading is formatted -->
         <p>A  "Hello, World!" program is generally a simple<em> computer program </em> that emits (or displays) to the screen
         (often the console) a message similar to<strong> "Hello, World!"</strong>. A small piece of code in most general-purpose
          programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. A "Hello, World!" program 
          is often the first written by a student of a new programming language, but such a program can also be used as
           a sanity check to ensure that the computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly
            installed, and that its operator understands how to use it. This is a simple HTML document. </p>
